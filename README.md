# SocialMedia-API-Backend

In this Project we build a full fledge api in python. The api that we build is for a social media type applications where, users can create/read/delete/update posts, as well as like other users posts and of course we will setup user registration and authentication. We build this api using the FastAPI library. 

We are using the Postgres Database and SqlAlchemy ORM for storing all the users data.

We also Tests our application using the pytest library. We'll setup a test database and perform a good number of integration tests.

Finally we'll build out a CI/CD pipeline using github actions so that we don't have to do everything manually.
